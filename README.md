<p align="left">Name's <b>Aid</b> (21+ â€¢ she/her â€¢ INFP); artist & game designer, mostly here to chill with friends, casually chat, and blab about Genshin and OCs. I am a yumeshipper, and my <a href="https://toyhou.se/10313327.-genshin-impact-sylvie">OC Sylvie</a> (they/them) kisses and holds hands with Zhongli (ðŸŒ¿ðŸ”¶), you can see them in the emote below and sometimes as a skin I'll take on. I will blab for hours if you ask me about them or Zhongli!!! Though I am non-sharing, so I won't discuss other ships with him (esp Zhongli/Childe, I literally want nothing to do with that ship, sorry).</p>

<p align="left"><b>For PonyTown Info:</b> I am always open to <b>cuddles and hiding</b> for people if they need it, though I am a bit shy with talking so I don't <i>usually</i> initiate convos. Kiss emotes are <b>okay</b> with me, I just do not return them if you're not friendsâ€”as for friend reqs, I will tend to ignore them if we haven't chatted to some degree!!! I also don't really roleplay, sorry; I'll do lighthearted banter as my skins, but it's really not my interest here (I'm a tumblr RP girly).</p>

<p align="left">If I'm ðŸŒ™ I'm <i>usually</i> still around, just not as chatty (or genuinely AFK if I'm using the sleep emote) so you can whisp me to get my attention if I don't poof; if I'm â›” it means I'm in the middle of something so I can't really talk, or very low energy for socializing, so I may only just respond with emotes and nothing else. I normally hang out in the Genshin area or the campfire!</p>
