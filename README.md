<p align="left">Name's <b>Aid</b> though I'm known as Asuraid online; mostly here to chill with friends, casually chat, and blab about Genshin and OCs. I am a <i>yumeshipper</i>, and my <a href="https://toyhou.se/10313327.-genshin-impact-sylvie">OC Sylvie</a> (they/she) kisses and holds hands with <a href="https://toyhou.se/10313327.sylvie/14798357.zhongvie">Zhongli</a>; I will blab for hours if you ask me about them or Zhongli!!! I also <b><i>ADORE</i></b> other people's OC/Canons and/or self-ships, though I am non-sharing with Zhongli, sorry. ðŸ¥²</p>

<blockquote><b>Interests:</b> genshin impact â€¢ star rail â€¢ ace attorney â€¢ omniscent reader's viewpoint â€¢ fire emblem â€¢ pokemon â€¢ elsword (don't ask me abt gameplay I'll rant) â€¢ MXTX's danmei works â€¢ FFXIV â€¢ hades (the game) â€¢ stardew valley â€¢ FAITH â€¢ code vein</blockquote>

<p align="left"><b>For PonyTown Info/BYI:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>No real DNI (minus anti OC/Canon ppl), I'll just hide/block if you're being weird.</li>
  <li>I <i>really</i> would prefer not talking about other Zhongli ships though, and <i>please</i> don't be weird about interactions if I'm on my Zhongli skin (especially as Childe or Xiao, I <i>do not</i> like those ships).<br><sup>Not a DNI if you like other ships with him, just <i>please</i> be aware I'll avoid talking about them or move on with the conversation to a different topic.</sup></li>
  <li>I normally hang out in the Genshin area or the campfire! I may cuddle if you have it in your name and I'm just vibing (please come cuddle with me if I'm alone LOL I <i>love</i> cuddles, even if they're silent).</li>
  <li>If I'm ðŸŒ™ I'm <i>usually</i> still around, just not as chatty (or genuinely AFK if I'm using the sleep emote) so you can whisp me to get my attention if I don't poof. If I'm â›” it means I'm offtab, in the middle of something/a convo, or very low energy for socializing, so I may only just respond with emotes, or with a delay.</li>
  <li>I am a bit shy with talking so I don't <i>usually</i> initiate convos/new topics, minus maybe giving a friendly poke if we share interests. If you're on a GI OC skin ... I'll shyly sit close. I don't bite so please feel free to interact!!</li> 
  <li>Kiss/nuzzle emotes are <i>a-okay</i> with me, I love being platonically affectionate!! Also not much for ships, so cuds and kisses are fully platonic (unless it's certain friends on a Zhongli skin then Sylvie <i>is</i> kissing them).</li>
  <li>As for friend reqs, I will tend to ignore them if we haven't chatted to some degree!!! You can ask if we can be friends, but I usually like having people I've talked to a bit. I normally don't send them myself too often. ;_;</li>
  <li>I don't really roleplay, sorry; I'll do lighthearted banter as my skins with friends, but it's really not my interest here.</li>
</ul>
