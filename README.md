<p align="left">Name's <b>Aid</b> though I'm known as Asuraid online; mostly here to chill with friends, casually chat, and blab about Genshin and OCs. I am a yumeshipper, and my <a href="https://toyhou.se/10313327.-genshin-impact-sylvie">OC Sylvie</a> (they/she) kisses and holds hands with <a href="https://toyhou.se/10313327.sylvie/14798357.zhongvie">Zhongli</a>; I will blab for hours if you ask me about them or Zhongli!!! I also <b><i>ADORE</i></b> other people's OC/Canons and/or self-ships, though I am non-sharing.</p>

<blockquote><b>Interests:</b> genshin impact â€¢ star rail â€¢ ace attorney â€¢ omniscent reader's viewpoint â€¢ fire emblem â€¢ pokemon â€¢ elsword (don't ask me abt gameplay I'll rant) â€¢ MXTX's danmei works â€¢ FFXIV â€¢ hades (the game) â€¢ stardew valley â€¢ FAITH the unholy trinity</blockquote>

<p align="left"><b>For PonyTown Info/BYI:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>No real DNI, I'll just hide/block if you're being weird. Would prefer not talking about other Zhongli ships though, and don't be weird about interactions if I'm on my Zhongli skin (especially on Childe, I do not care for Tartali/Zhongchi <i>at all</i>).</li>
  <li>I am a bit shy with talking so I don't <i>usually</i> initiate convos/new topics, minus maybe giving a friendly poke if we share interests.</li> 
  <li>Kiss emotes are <i>okay</i> with me, I just do not return them if you're not friendsâ€”as for friend reqs, I will tend to ignore them if we haven't chatted to some degree!!!</li>
  <li>I don't really roleplay, sorry; I'll do lighthearted banter as my skins with friends, but it's really not my interest here.</li>
  <li>If I'm ðŸŒ™ I'm <i>usually</i> still around, just not as chatty (or genuinely AFK if I'm using the sleep emote) so you can whisp me to get my attention if I don't poof. If I'm â›” it means I'm in the middle of something so I can't really talk, or very low energy for socializing, so I may only just respond with emotes and nothing else.</li>
  <li>I normally hang out in the Genshin area or the campfire!</li>
</ul>
